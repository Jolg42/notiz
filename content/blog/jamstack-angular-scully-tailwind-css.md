[Scully](https://scully.io/) is a static site generator build for the web framework [Angular](https://angular.io/). You learn how to build a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/) project with Angular and Scully. Let's add [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for easy styling, the cherry üçí  on the cake üç∞.

## TL;DR

Create a new Angular project, add Scully and Tailwind CSS using schematics.

```bash
ng new app-name --style=scss --routing true
cd app-name

ng add @scullyio/init

ng add ngx-tailwind
```

Angular provides [schematics](https://angular.io/guide/schematics) for generating and performing installation steps automatically for you - used by Scully and [ngx-tailwind](https://github.com/notiz-dev/ngx-tailwind). üíØ

## Remove unused CSS for production build üßπ

Tailwind generates a lot of CSS styles which are very helpful during development. Before deploying the Scully app [remove all unused CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size#removing-unused-css) using the `purge` option in `tailwind.config.js`. Provide paths of your template and TypeScript files:

```diff
module.exports = {
  future: {
    // removeDeprecatedGapUtilities: true,
    // purgeLayersByDefault: true,
  },
+ purge: ["./src/**/*.html", "./src/**/*.ts"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
};
```

Tailwind automatically purges unused styles when `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`. Use the script added by `ngx-tailwind`

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

Open `app.component.html` and replace the content with the following template using Tailwind utility styles.

```html
<div class="min-h-screen bg-gray-100 py-6 flex flex-col justify-center">
  <div class="mx-auto p-20 rounded-lg shadow-lg bg-white">
    <p class="text-4xl font-semibold">Angular + Scully + Tailwind = üöÄ</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Start Scully

Getting started to serve Angular as a Jamstack app for the first time. Follow the steps in this order.

1. First build Angular app

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

2. Build Scully app

```bash
npm run scully
```

All pre-rendered static  site files are generated in `./dist/static`. For each page you will see an `index.html` file.

3. Scully app

```bash
npm run scully:serve
```

Open your favorite browser and go to [http://localhost:1668/](http://localhost:1668/) for the Scully static server and [http://localhost:1864/](http://localhost:1864/) for the Angular server.

You should see on both links - Angular top üëÜ, Scully bottom üëá.

## What's added by Scully? üîç

Scully creates a [config](https://scully.io/docs/reference/config/) file `scully.<projectname>.config.ts` at the root folder. You will look at this in a moment.

Additionally, after your first Scully build new few new files are generated by Scully. Let's add those to the `.gitignore` file

```
# Scully
.scully
scully.log
src/assets/scully-routes.json
scully/plugins/*.js
scully/plugins/*.js.map
```
