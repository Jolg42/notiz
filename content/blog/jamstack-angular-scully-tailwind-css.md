[Scully](https://scully.io/) is a static site generator build for the web framework [Angular](https://angular.io/). You learn how to build a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/) project with Angular and Scully. Let's add [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for easy styling, the cherry üçí  on the cake üç∞.

## TL;DR

Create a new Angular project, add Scully and Tailwind CSS using schematics. Angular provides [schematics](https://angular.io/guide/schematics) for generating and performing installation steps automatically for you - used by Scully and [ngx-tailwind](https://github.com/notiz-dev/ngx-tailwind). üíØ

```bash
ng new app-name --style=scss --routing true
cd app-name

ng add @scullyio/init

ng add ngx-tailwind
```

Or follow along with the [source code](https://github.com/notiz-dev/angular-scully-tailwindcss).

## Remove unused CSS for production build üßπ

Tailwind generates a lot of CSS styles which are very helpful during development. Before deploying the Scully app [remove all unused CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size#removing-unused-css) using the `purge` option in `tailwind.config.js`. Provide paths of your template and TypeScript files:

```diff
module.exports = {
  future: {
    // removeDeprecatedGapUtilities: true,
    // purgeLayersByDefault: true,
  },
+ purge: ["./src/**/*.html", "./src/**/*.ts"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
};
```

Tailwind automatically purges unused styles when `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`. Use the script added by `ngx-tailwind`

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

Open `app.component.html` and add a `header` template using Tailwind utility styles.

```html
<div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 xl:max-w-5xl xl:px-0">
  <header class="flex justify-between items-center py-10">
    <div>
      <a href="/" class="text-xl font-semibold"> Angular + Scully + Tailwind = üöÄ </a>
    </div>
    <div>
      <a href="https://github.com/notiz-dev/angular-scully-tailwindcss" class="font-medium text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-700"> Source Code &rarr; </a>
    </div>
  </header>

  <main>
    <!-- Displaying Angular routes -->
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>
  </main>
</div>
```

Customize your own header on [play.tailwindcss.com](https://play.tailwindcss.com/CyNMJvURiy).

## Start Scully

Getting started to serve Angular as a Jamstack app for the first time. Follow the steps in this order.

First build Angular app

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

Build Scully app

```bash
npm run scully
```

All pre-rendered static  site files are generated in `./dist/static`. For each page you will see an `index.html` file.

Scully app

```bash
npm run scully:serve
```

Open your favorite browser and go to [http://localhost:1668/](http://localhost:1668/) for the Scully static server and [http://localhost:1864/](http://localhost:1864/) for the Angular server.

You should see on both links - Angular top üëÜ, Scully bottom üëá.

## What's added by Scully? üîç

Scully creates a [config](https://scully.io/docs/reference/config/) file `scully.<projectname>.config.ts` at the root folder. You will look at this in a moment.

Additionally, after your first Scully build new few new files are generated by Scully. Let's add those to the `.gitignore` file

```bash
# Scully
.scully
scully.log
src/assets/scully-routes.json
scully/plugins/*.js
scully/plugins/*.js.map
```

## Markdown blog

One üíç command to rule your blog

```bash
ng generate @scullyio/init:blog
```

Do you need more flexibility? Try running the following and answer a few [questions](https://scully.io/docs/learn/create-a-blog/add-blog-support/#available-options):

```bash
ng generate @scullyio/init:markdown
```

Now your blog is setup. A new route like `/blog/<slug>` has been added, re-build your Angular app and discover the new route with Scully

```bash
npm run scully -- --scanRoutes
```

Serve your Scully app and navigate to the first generated post in your browser `localhost:1668/blog/<slug>`.

![First Scully Blog Post](assets/img/blog/jamstack-angular-scully-tailwind-css/optimized/first-scully-blog-post.png)

Scully creates for each blog post an `index.html` inside your `dist/static/blog` directory.

## Style blog post page

Alright, you got your first blog post page rendered, but let's be honest üßê it needs a few adjustment. The current blog post page is missing the **blog post title**, **publishing date** and has **unstyled** content. 

Scully has a build in service `ScullyRoutesService` to access the front matter of your blog posts. It exposes all published posts under `ScullyRoutesService.available$` and the current page with `ScullyRoutesService.getCurrent()`.

Open your generated `blog.component.ts` and use `ScullyRoutesService.getCurrent()`

```ts
import { Component, OnInit, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute, Router } from '@angular/router';
import { ScullyRoute, ScullyRoutesService } from '@scullyio/ng-lib';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-blog',
  templateUrl: './blog.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./blog.component.scss'],
  preserveWhitespaces: true,
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated,
})
export class BlogComponent implements OnInit {
  currentPost$: Observable<ScullyRoute> = this.scully.getCurrent();

  constructor(
    private router: Router,
    private route: ActivatedRoute,
    private scully: ScullyRoutesService
  ) {}

  ngOnInit() {}
}
```

In your template use `async` pipe to unwrap the `Observable` to access the `title` and `publishedAt` (custom property).

```html
<article>
  <header *ngIf="currentPost$ | async as currentPost" class="pt-6 xl:pb-10">
    <div class="space-y-1 text-center">
      <dl class="space-y-10" *ngIf="currentPost.publishedAt">
        <div>
          <dt class="sr-only">Published on</dt>
          <dd class="text-base leading-6 font-medium text-gray-500">
            <time [dateTime]="currentPost.publishedAt"> {{ currentPost.publishedAt | date: "dd MMMM yyyy" }} </time>
          </dd>
        </div>
      </dl>
      <div>
        <h1 class="text-3xl leading-9 font-extrabold text-gray-900 tracking-tight sm:text-4xl sm:leading-10 md:text-5xl md:leading-14">{{ currentPost.title }}</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
  </header>

  <!-- This is where Scully will inject the static HTML -->
  <scully-content></scully-content>
</article>
```

Check out [Tailwind Blog](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/) which is used here as reference for styling a simple and clean blog.

Update your blog front matter to set `published` to `true`, add `publishedAt` with a datetime string and remove any unpublished `slug`, also add some placeholder content:

<pre lang="md"><code class="language-markdown">---
title: 2020-10-23-blog
description: "blog description"
published: true
publishedAt: 2020-10-31T13:37:00.000Z

# Pizza üçï

Eat **pizza** hawaii *everyday*. ~~Don't forget~~ the üßÄ on your `pizza`.

```
var pizza = "Eat üçï".
alert(pizza);
```

## Hawaii

Ordered List

1. üçç
2. ü•ì
3. üßÄ

Unordered List

* üßÄ
* üçç
* ü•ì

### Diavolo

> Pizza might be very üå∂Ô∏è
</code></pre>

Last but not least, remove all styles from `blog.component.scss`. Now re-build Angular, Scully and serve Scully to see the new blog post header

![Scully blog post header with title and published date](assets/img/blog/jamstack-angular-scully-tailwind-css/optimized/scully-post-with-header.png)

Awesome ü§© looks much better. What about the unstyled content? ü§® Go and install [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography#installation) plugin applying styles to your markdown content.

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```

Add the plugin to your `tailwind.config.js` 

```js
module.exports = {
  future: {
    // removeDeprecatedGapUtilities: true,
    // purgeLayersByDefault: true,
  },
  purge: ["./src/**/*.html", "./src/**/*.ts"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/typography')],
};
```

Now wrap `<scully-content></scully-content>` with the `prose` class provided by the Tailwind Typography plugin:

```html
<article>
  <header>
    ...
  </header>

  <div class="prose max-w-none pt-10 pb-8">
    <!-- This is where Scully will inject the static HTML -->
    <scully-content></scully-content>
  </div>
</article>
```

Blog post content is now styled üòé. How easy was that? Feel free to further [customize](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography#customization) the styles to your brand or personal style.
